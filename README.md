This repository is built for AI infrastructure engineers who want agents to do
real work, not recite generic prompts.

It gives an agent the operational memory needed to benchmark SGLang, vLLM,
TensorRT-LLM, and TokenSpeed fairly; audit SGLang upgrades against real launch
profiles, breaking changes, known issues, and canary requirements; explain
serving capacity from startup logs; split prefill and decode profiler evidence;
inspect traces at layer and kernel level; estimate operator FLOPs and MFU;
review SGLang patches against real maintainer discussion patterns; run
Humanize-governed SGLang and vLLM SOTA loops; triage SGLang production
incidents from a replay; and keep model-family optimization history close to
the code that actually changed.

For standalone kernel campaigns and kernel evidence tools, see the sibling
project **[KDA-Pilot](https://github.com/BBuf/KDA-Pilot)**.

If this saves you one stale model-support assumption, one misleading profiler
trace, or one late-night benchmark loop, a star helps more AI-infra engineers
find it.

## Core Skills

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| [`llm-serving-auto-benchmark`](skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark/) | You need a fair, bounded serving benchmark search for SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, TokenSpeed, or another OpenAI-compatible stack. |
| [`sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor`](skills/sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor/) | You need to match an SGLang version interval against actual launch profiles, propose safe argv/import migrations, and produce GO/CONDITIONAL_GO/NO_GO decisions with canaries and rollback. |
| [`llm-serving-capacity-planner`](skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner/) | You need to explain SGLang or vLLM startup memory, KV cache budget, request capacity, or OOM pressure from logs. |
| [`llm-torch-profiler-analysis`](skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis/) | You need a three-table profiler report that keeps `extend/prefill` and `decode` evidence separate. |
| [`llm-pipeline-analysis`](skills/llm-pipeline-analysis/) | You need forward-pass, layer, and kernel-level timing from a torch profiler trace, including anchor boundaries and Perfetto ranges. |
| [`model-compute-simulation`](skills/model-compute-simulation/) | You need operator shapes, FLOPs, MFU estimates, kernel-to-op mapping, or parallelism what-if analysis for an LLM serving shape. |
| [`model-pr-diff-dossier`](skills/model-optimization/model-pr-diff-dossier/) | You need to create or revise model PR history docs with manual diff-reviewed cards instead of shallow PR-title summaries. |
| [`sglang-humanize-review`](skills/sglang-humanize-review/) | You need SGLang code-review findings grounded in full human PR review episodes from project start through the latest refresh (June 2026), including inline code context, top-level discussion, review summaries, and multi-round replies. Every review opens with a PR comprehension pass — a change summary plus a Mermaid execution flowchart with the diff's modified steps marked — so the reviewer sees how the PR runs before the findings. |
| [`sglang-sota-humanize-loop`](skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop/) | You want one model-level Humanize RLCR loop that owns SGLang gap decisions against a selected comparison framework set, profiler triage, required layer-pipeline deep dives, SGLang patches, optional `ncu-report-skill` evidence, and real-model revalidation after the fixed fair benchmark. |
| [`vllm-sota-humanize-loop`](skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop/) | You want one model-level Humanize RLCR loop that owns gap decisions, profiler triage, required layer-pipeline deep dives, vLLM patches, optional `ncu-report-skill` evidence, and real-model revalidation after the fixed fair benchmark. |
| [`sglang-prod-incident-triage`](skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage/) | You need to turn queue growth, timeouts, wrong outputs, crashes, or distributed stalls into a replay and next debug step. |
| [`model-architecture-diagram`](skills/model-architecture-diagram/) | You need original public architecture diagrams for popular LLM, VLM, MoE, OCR, and diffusion model families. |

## SGLang SOTA Performance Loop

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBuf/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS/main/docs/assets/sglang-sota-performance-loop.svg" alt="SGLang SOTA Performance Loop" width="620">
</p>

`sglang-sota-humanize-loop` always patches SGLang, while the competitor set is
caller-controlled. By default the comparison framework set can include vLLM,
TensorRT-LLM, and TokenSpeed; a prompt can also narrow it, for example:

```text
Use sglang-sota-humanize-loop for <model>.
comparison_frameworks: [vllm]
Do not consider TensorRT-LLM or TokenSpeed; record them as user-excluded.
```

## Model PR History Catalog

The model optimization layer is now one knowledge base:
[`model-pr-optimization-history`](model-pr-optimization-history/). It contains
66 PR-driven history dossiers and a small query helper. These are not
per-model runbook skills; they preserve diff-backed model evolution records for
SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, and TokenSpeed so SOTA loops can read prior source
and PR evidence before patching.

| Framework | PR histories |
| --- | ---: |
| [SGLang](model-pr-optimization-history/sglang/) | 31 |
| [vLLM](model-pr-optimization-history/vllm/) | 31 |
| [TensorRT-LLM](model-pr-optimization-history/tensorrt_llm/) | 2 |
| [TokenSpeed](model-pr-optimization-history/tokenspeed/) | 2 |

Covered families include:

```text
DeepSeek V3/R1/V3.1/V3.2/V4, Qwen3, Qwen3-Coder, Qwen3-Next,
Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6, Qwen VLM/Omni/ASR, GLM 4.5/4.6/4.7/5,
Kimi, MiniMax, Llama 4, Mistral Small 4, Mixtral, Nemotron,
Gemma, Ernie 4.5, Intern-S1, InternVL, Hunyuan, MOSS-VL,
GPT-OSS, Step 3.5, Mimo, and model-specific MoE/quantization paths.
```

Each model-family history is designed to answer practical questions:

- Which PRs changed this model path?
- Was the PR merged, closed, or still open?
- Which files and symbols moved?
- What optimization or correctness risk should be checked before touching it?
- Which upstream idea should be compared before writing a new kernel or fusion?

Query examples:

```bash
cd model-pr-optimization-history
python3 scripts/query.py --list
python3 scripts/query.py --framework sglang --model qwen3-core --paths-only
python3 scripts/query.py --framework vllm "qwen3 fused qk norm"
python3 scripts/query.py --framework tokenspeed --model qwen35 qk rmsnorm
```

Open PR freshness is tracked separately from merged history cards:

```bash
python3 tools/check_open_pr_watch.py --format markdown \
  --output model-pr-optimization-history/open-pr-watch.md
```

This report uses the GitHub pulls API with an anonymous REST fallback when
`gh api` is rate-limited. If every repo fetch fails, the tool exits non-zero
instead of writing a misleading empty report.

## Evidence Standards

The repo is opinionated about evidence because performance work gets noisy fast.

- Benchmark rows should include model, framework, GPU count, workload, request
  rate or concurrency, SLA status, launch command, benchmark command, and raw
  artifacts.
- Upgrade audits should resolve immutable version endpoints, match
  source-linked changes to actual argv/profile evidence, and require target
  canaries before a `GO`.
- Profiler reports should keep prefill and decode separate, then emit the same
  three tables: kernel table, overlap-opportunity table, and fuse-opportunity
  table.
- SOTA claims should be scoped to the exact model, hardware, framework commits,
  precision, workload, and SLA used in the run.
- SGLang human review should use the full PR episode corpus: inline review
  threads for line-local findings, PR conversations for design/test/repro
  negotiation, and review submissions for blocking maintainer summaries.
- Humanize SOTA loops should keep only the fixed fair benchmark outside the
  patch loop; gap decisions, profiler triage, required layer-pipeline deep
  dives, kernel evidence, target-framework code changes, and revalidation all
  stay inside one model-level RLCR loop.
- Kernel-local fixes inside that loop should use `ncu-report-skill` when Nsight
  Compute counter evidence is needed, store NCU digests, and still pass the
  same real-model benchmark/profile gate.
- Incident triage should start from replayable evidence instead of changing code
  from symptoms alone.
- Model optimization histories should point back to PRs, files, diffs, and risk
  surfaces rather than vague summary text; they live as one PR-driven knowledge
  base, not per-model skills.
- Root-level [`update_prompt.md`](update_prompt.md) captures the full refresh
  and validation workflow for updating this repo again without relying on
  memory from a previous run.

## Install

This repository is not Codex-only. The skills are plain `SKILL.md` directories
and can be installed into Claude Code, Codex, Kimi, or another compatible agent
runtime.

### Claude Code (one-shot plugin install)

The repository ships a `.claude-plugin/` manifest so the whole skill set can be
installed as a single Claude Code plugin via the built-in marketplace flow:

```text
/plugin marketplace add BBuf/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS
/plugin install ai-infra-auto-driven-skills@ai-infra-auto-driven-skills
/reload-plugins
```

After reload, the 13 skills appear namespaced as
`ai-infra-auto-driven-skills:<skill-name>` (for example
`ai-infra-auto-driven-skills:sglang-sota-humanize-loop`). Update later with
`/plugin marketplace update ai-infra-auto-driven-skills`.

### Claude Code (per-skill symlink, legacy)

Prefer this when you only want a subset of the skills, or when developing
against a local checkout. Symlink is recommended for local development because
updates to this checkout are picked up immediately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BBuf/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS.git
cd AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark" ~/.claude/skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner" ~/.claude/skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis" ~/.claude/skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-pipeline-analysis" ~/.claude/skills/llm-pipeline-analysis
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-compute-simulation" ~/.claude/skills/model-compute-simulation
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-optimization/model-pr-diff-dossier" ~/.claude/skills/model-pr-diff-dossier
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-humanize-review" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-humanize-review
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop
ln -s "$PWD/skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop" ~/.claude/skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-architecture-diagram" ~/.claude/skills/model-architecture-diagram
ln -s "$PWD/model-pr-optimization-history" ~/.claude/skills/model-pr-history-knowledge
```

Restart Claude Code after installing. The skills can then be invoked by name,
for example `[$llm-serving-auto-benchmark]`,
`[$sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor]`,
`[$llm-serving-capacity-planner]`, `[$llm-torch-profiler-analysis]`,
`[$llm-pipeline-analysis]`, `[$model-compute-simulation]`,
`[$model-pr-diff-dossier]`, `[$sglang-humanize-review]`,
`[$sglang-sota-humanize-loop]`, or `[$vllm-sota-humanize-loop]`.

If you prefer copies instead of symlinks, replace `ln -s` with `cp -R`. Copy
`model-pr-optimization-history` only when you want the agent to query the
PR-driven model knowledge base locally. It replaces the old per-model runbook
skill layout with one shared knowledge root.

### Generic Agent Skill Directory

For Codex, Kimi, or another compatible runtime, copy or symlink the same
directories into that runtime's skill directory:

```bash
cp -R skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark <agent-skill-dir>/llm-serving-auto-benchmark
cp -R skills/sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-upgrade-readiness-auditor
cp -R skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner <agent-skill-dir>/llm-serving-capacity-planner
cp -R skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis <agent-skill-dir>/llm-torch-profiler-analysis
cp -R skills/llm-pipeline-analysis <agent-skill-dir>/llm-pipeline-analysis
cp -R skills/model-compute-simulation <agent-skill-dir>/model-compute-simulation
cp -R skills/model-optimization/model-pr-diff-dossier <agent-skill-dir>/model-pr-diff-dossier
cp -R skills/sglang-humanize-review <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-humanize-review
cp -R skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-sota-humanize-loop
cp -R skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop <agent-skill-dir>/vllm-sota-humanize-loop
cp -R skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-prod-incident-triage
cp -R skills/model-architecture-diagram <agent-skill-dir>/model-architecture-diagram
cp -R model-pr-optimization-history <agent-skill-dir>/model-pr-history-knowledge
```

## How I Drive The Agents

These skills are exercised with coding agents in full-autonomy mode. For
reproducibility, here is exactly how I launch them.

**Claude Code** — use the current Opus alias with Auto permission mode:

```bash
claude --model opus --permission-mode auto
```

`opus` tracks Claude Code's current Opus model instead of pinning a model number.
Auto mode can approve routine work while retaining the permission system.
`bypassPermissions` (or `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) should be reserved for
an isolated sandbox, ideally without internet access.

**Codex** — full-access, no approval prompts:

```bash
codex --sandbox danger-full-access --ask-for-approval never
```

The Codex command is intentionally unsandboxed and should likewise be used only
inside an isolated environment with a scoped checkout and its own benchmark and
correctness gates.
