| PR | Model / area | Status | Current signal | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#16469](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/16469) | Qwen3.5/3.6 attention | merged | fused QK norm + RoPE + gate | Collapses attention preprocessing and output gating launches; compare traces only after recording this fused path. |
| [#15194](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15194) | Qwen3-Next / Qwen3.5 | merged | Gemma RMSNorm + AllReduce | Changes TP collective ownership and removes standalone norm work. |
| [#14848](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/14848) | Kimi K2.5 / NVFP4 | merged | RMSNorm + FP4 quant fusion | Adds the Blackwell fused normalization/quantization edge used by Kimi-style MLA. |
| [#15249](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15249) | Qwen3.5-VL Dense | merged | dense multimodal support | Establishes the dense VLM model/config/weight-mapper and parity lane. |
| [#14599](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/14599) | Qwen3.5-VL MoE | merged | MoE VLM + MTP fixes | Establishes the MoE multimodal wrapper and speculative token plumbing. |
| [#15594](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15594) | Qwen3.5 GDN | merged | piecewise CUDA graph capture fix | Captures the GDN path that older images left outside piecewise graphs. |
| [#11685](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/11685) | KV cache runtime | merged | evict empty blocks first | Affects cache pressure and request residency under serving load; stale TensorRT-LLM images can mislead long-context or prefix-heavy rows. |
| [#15546](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15546) | PyTorch executor KV cache | merged | fresh host buffer for KV block offsets | Affects race/overlap risk around KV block offset staging in benchmark and profiler traces. |
| [#15543](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15543) | Qwen3.5 | merged | EPLB support | Changes Qwen3.5 MoE load-balancing behavior and benchmark fairness knobs. |
| [#15185](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15185) | Qwen3.5 AutoDeploy | merged | sharding and lm_head sharding | Affects AutoDeploy/PyTorch backend memory and parallelism comparisons. |
| [#15067](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15067) | Qwen3.5 | merged | FP8 checkpoint loading | Relevant when comparing dense/MoE Qwen3.5 checkpoints across frameworks. |
| [#15233](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15233) | Kimi K2.5 | merged | rejection-sampling embedding mask | Affects speculative decoding / guided decoding comparisons. |
| [#15180](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15180) | Kimi K2.5 | merged | guided decoding methods | Relevant when Kimi agentic/tool traces use guided decoding. |
| [#12788](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/12788) | Kimi K2.5 VLM | merged | multimodal vision support | Establishes TensorRT-LLM Kimi-K2.5 multimodal path and tests. |
