# Model Compute Simulation

## Overview

Use this when the question is about operator order, tensor dimensions, FLOPs,
MFU, or parallelism checks. The simulator loads a model config, builds the
representative operator sequence, prints tensor shapes and FLOPs, and can
estimate MFU from measured latency.

## Confirmation Required

Before running a simulation, collect or verify these inputs:

| Item | Why it matters | How to obtain | Default if user skips |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model name | Resolves to config in `model-config-index.json`; determines entire architecture | Ask user or infer from trace context | — (required) |
| Config accuracy | Indexed values may differ from actual serving config (e.g. `routed_expert_intermediate_size`, `compress_ratios`) | Ask user to provide `config.json` or verify key params against HuggingFace | Use indexed values with a caveat |
| GPU type | Determines peak FLOPS for MFU denominator | Ask user | — (required for MFU) |
| dtype (bf16 / fp8) | Affects peak FLOPS selection; fp8 doubles peak | Ask user | bf16 |
| Batch size & seq len | Directly affects FLOPs and tensor shapes | Ask user | B=1, S=1 (decode) |
| TP / DP / EP | TP splits GEMM FLOPs across GPUs; EP splits expert FLOPs | Ask user | TP=8, DP=1, EP=8 |
| Measured latency (ms) | Required for MFU numerator; must be per-GPU forward-pass wall-clock | Ask user or extract from a profiler trace | — (optional, no MFU without it) |

If the model is not in `model-config-index.json`, ask the user for a
`config.json` path or add an indexed config before running estimates.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load model config

Resolve the model name and load its configuration parameters:

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "<model name>" --list-models
```

The script resolves the model name against `references/model-config-index.json`, which stores public HuggingFace config parameters (hidden_size, num_experts, MLA ranks, etc.).

If the model is not indexed, tell the user to provide a `config.json` path or request an index update.

### Step 2: Generate execution flow and tensor dimensions

Run the simulator with batch size, sequence length, and parallelism configuration:

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "Qwen3-235B-A22B" \
  --batch-size 1 --seq-len 1 \
  --tp 8 --dp 1 --ep 8 \
  --gpu h20 --dtype bf16
```

The simulator prints:
- Per-layer operator sequence with FLOPs and tensor shapes (shape_in → shape_out)
- Attention vs MoE/FFN FLOPs proportion per layer
- Total model FLOPs for a single forward pass

For **decode**: use `--seq-len 1`.
For **prefill**: use `--seq-len <prompt_length>`.

### Step 3: Estimate MFU with measured latency

Provide the measured forward-pass latency to compute MFU:

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "Qwen3-235B-A22B" \
  --batch-size 1 --seq-len 1 \
  --tp 8 --dp 1 --ep 8 \
  --gpu h20 --dtype bf16 \
  --measured-ms 15.0
```

MFU = theoretical_min_time / measured_time × 100%

The simulator prints:
- Overall MFU
- Per-layer MFU (uniform layer-time assumption)
- Per-operator FLOPs proportion (for identifying which ops dominate)

GPU peak FLOPS are loaded from `references/gpu-specs.json`. The bundled
hardware table includes H20, H100 SXM 80GB, H200 SXM 141GB, and B200 SXM
180GB. Use aliases such as `--gpu h100`, `--gpu h200`, or `--gpu b200` when
running on those local boxes.

### Step 4: Per-operator MFU with kernel-level latency

When you have per-kernel measured latency, compute per-operator MFU by mapping
kernel durations to the compute flow.

#### Method A: `--kernel-flow` (kernel-level MFU, recommended)

Provide per-kernel detail as JSON, then feed it to the simulator for
kernel-level MFU analysis. This preserves every kernel row from the compute
flow and adds FLOPs/MFU columns.

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "Qwen3-235B-A22B" \
  --batch-size 1 --seq-len 8192 \
  --tp 8 --dp 1 --ep 8 \
  --gpu h20 --dtype bf16 \
  --kernel-flow @/tmp/layer3_detail.json
```

The `--kernel-flow` parameter accepts a JSON string or `@file` path. It produces
a **kernel-level MFU table** that preserves all kernel rows from the compute
flow and adds:
- `Mapped Op`: which operator this kernel maps to
- `FLOPs`: operator's total FLOPs
- `Theo(us)`: theoretical minimum time
- `MFU%`: measured FLOPs utilization
- `shape_in→shape_out`: operator tensor dimensions

When `--kernel-flow` is provided, the static per-operator template is omitted
because the kernel-level MFU table already carries per-kernel shape and FLOPs
information. The output keeps the model summary, serving configuration, total
FLOPs, overall MFU calculated from the measured layer duration, and the
kernel-level MFU table. In `--format json`, the raw evidence is stored under
`kernel_flow` and no text table is appended.

Mapping rules:
- **Direct-match kernels** (mla, moe, mhc, rmsnorm, hadamard, rope, quant, topk, etc.): time is assigned directly to the corresponding operators
- **Generic GEMM kernels** (gemm_fp8, gemm_bf16): time is distributed to remaining unassigned projection GEMM operators by FLOPs share
- **Overhead kernels** (allreduce, moe_align, moe_sort, other): rows preserved, FLOPs/MFU marked as N/A

**FP8 kernel MFU correction**: Kernels in categories `moe` (fused_moe_kernel)
and `gemm_fp8` use fp8 math internally even when `--dtype bf16` is specified.
For these kernels, the MFU denominator uses the GPU's fp8 peak FLOPS
(2x bf16 peak) instead of bf16 peak. The resulting MFU is marked with a
superscript `⁸` (for example, `63.7%⁸`) to show that the fp8 denominator was
used. `gemm_bf16` kernels still use the bf16 peak FLOPS denominator.

#### Method B: `--kernel-detail` (operator-level MFU, legacy)

Same input as `--kernel-flow` but outputs an **operator-level** summary table
(aggregated by operator, not per-kernel). Use when you want a compact view.

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "Qwen3-235B-A22B" \
  --batch-size 1 --seq-len 8192 \
  --tp 8 --dp 1 --ep 8 \
  --gpu h20 --dtype bf16 \
  --kernel-detail @/tmp/layer3_detail.json
```

#### Method C: `--kernel-ms` (category-level approximation)

Use a hand-aggregated category map only when per-kernel detail is unavailable:

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "Qwen3-235B-A22B" \
  --batch-size 1 --seq-len 8192 \
  --tp 8 --dp 1 --ep 8 \
  --gpu h20 --dtype bf16 \
  --kernel-ms '{
    "mla": 4.922, "moe": 1.644, "allreduce": 0.769,
    "hadamard": 0.348, "mhc": 1.388, "gemm_fp8": 1.692,
    "gemm_bf16": 0.125, "rmsnorm": 0.227, "quant": 0.311,
    "rope": 0.209, "topk": 0.122, "activation": 0.071,
    "other": 0.437
  }'
```

The `--kernel-ms` parameter accepts a JSON object mapping **kernel category** names
to their measured durations in **milliseconds**. It uses FLOPs-proportional
distribution across entire categories, which is less precise than `--kernel-detail`
because generic GEMM categories (gemm_fp8, gemm_bf16) span multiple operator categories.

Choose only one of `--per-layer-ms`, `--kernel-ms`, `--kernel-detail`, or
`--kernel-flow`. All measured durations must be positive.

Output includes:
- Model architecture summary (layers, hidden_size, attention_type, MoE config)
- Per-layer compute flow: operator sequence with tensor dimensions, FLOPs, shape_in→shape_out
- Per-operator MFU table: each operator's FLOPs, theoretical time, measured time (from trace), MFU%
- Kernel → operator mapping explanation (direct-match vs FLOPs-proportional vs overhead)
- Overall and per-layer MFU

## When To Use It

- when you need compute-level detail for a known model or config
- when the user asks about execution flow, tensor dimensions, or FLOPs for a specific serving shape
- when the user asks about MFU and can provide measured forward-pass latency
- when comparing compute profiles across different parallelism configurations

## Useful Commands

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py --list-models
```

List known GPU types:

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py --list-gpus
```

Emit JSON for automation:

```bash
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/model_compute_simulator.py "GLM-5" --format json
```

## Reporting Checklist

Include:

1. **Model architecture summary**: model name, config source, num_layers, hidden_size, attention_type, MoE config (num_experts, topk, shared_experts), MHC, head_dim
2. **Serving configuration**: batch_size, seq_len, TP, DP, EP, GPU, dtype
3. **Per-layer compute flow** (showing first representative layer in detail):
   - Operator sequence table: name, category, FLOPs, shape_in → shape_out
   - Attention vs MoE/FFN FLOPs proportion
4. **Total model FLOPs** for a single forward pass
5. **Kernel-level MFU table** (when `--kernel-flow` provided):
   - Preserves ALL kernel rows from the compute flow (never deleted)
   - Per-kernel columns: `# | Half | Category | Simplified Name | dur(us) | % | Mapped Op | FLOPs | Theo(us) | MFU% | shape_in→shape_out`
   - Direct-match kernels: show mapped operator FLOPs/MFU
   - Overhead kernels: show N/A for FLOPs/MFU, row preserved
6. **Operator-level MFU table** (when `--kernel-detail` or `--measured-ms` provided):
   - Each operator: name, category, total FLOPs, per-GPU FLOPs, theoretical time, measured time (from trace), MFU%
   - Kernel category → operator mapping explained
7. **Overall MFU** and **per-layer MFU**
8. **One-line summary**: dominant compute category, MFU status, key bottleneck

## Trace-Based Validation (extract_compute_flow_from_trace.py)

Use `scripts/extract_compute_flow_from_trace.py` to extract the real operator sequence and tensor dimensions from a torch profiler trace, then compare against the static template as ground truth validation.

```bash
# Extract compute flow from a trace
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/extract_compute_flow_from_trace.py \
  --input /path/to/trace.json.gz --format text

# Compare trace against static template
python3 skills/model-compute-simulation/scripts/extract_compute_flow_from_trace.py \
  --input /path/to/trace.json.gz \
  --compare qwen3-235b-a22b \
  --batch-size 1 --seq-len 1 --tp 8 --ep 8
```

Trace/template operation presence is compared through semantic families such
as `matmul`, `attention`, `norm`, and `router`; raw `aten::*` names are not
compared directly with semantic template names. A positive `--min-flops`
threshold removes operations whose FLOPs could not be determined.

### Compute Flow Confirmation Hierarchy

When the static template or trace extraction cannot fully confirm the compute process (e.g. ambiguous scope, missing shapes, new model architecture), follow this escalation hierarchy:

1. **Static template** (`model_compute_simulator.py` + `model-config-index.json`) — fast, covers known models
2. **Trace extraction** (`extract_compute_flow_from_trace.py`) — validates template against real execution
3. **Inference framework source code** — when trace is insufficient (missing `Input Dims`, CUDA Graph replay, compiled kernels without scope), read the model's forward flow directly from the serving framework source:
   - **SGLang**: `python/sglang/srt/models/<model_name>.py` — contains the `forward()` method with the exact operator sequence, tensor shapes, and parallelism split logic
   - **vLLM**: `vllm/model_executor/models/<model_name>.py`
   - **TensorRT-LLM**: `cpp/tensorrt_llm/pyexecutor/py_executor.cpp` + model config files

   When consulting framework source, focus on:
   - The `forward()` method: operator call order and residual connections
   - QKV / O projection: whether LoRA-style down/up projections are used (`q_lora_rank`, `o_lora_rank`)
   - MoE routing: top-k selection, shared vs routed expert split
   - TP/EP slicing: which dimensions are split and how FLOPs divide across GPUs
   - Any model-specific ops not in the static template (e.g. MHC, Hadamard, indexer)

   **Action**: If the framework source reveals discrepancies with the static template, update `model-config-index.json` and/or `build_layer_ops()` accordingly.

### Limitations of Trace Extraction

| Limitation | Detail | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| `record_shapes=True` required | Trace must be captured with shape recording enabled; without it, `Input Dims` fields are absent and FLOPs cannot be computed | SGLang live capture and vLLM `torch_profiler_with_stack=true` already enable this; TensorRT-LLM requires a `py_executor.py` override adding `record_shapes=True` |
| CUDA Graph mode | During graph replay, `cpu_op` events may only appear once (at capture time); shape information for replayed iterations is not re-recorded | The script detects graph capture phases and annotates affected ops; use eager-mode traces for full coverage |
| TP-sliced dimensions | Trace shows post-TP-split dimensions (e.g. `H/TP`), not the full-model view | Use `--tp` in `--compare` mode to scale trace FLOPs back to full-model equivalents |
| Scope attribution quality | Python scope depends on `with_stack=True`; some frameworks or compiled paths may produce shallow or missing scope chains | Graceful degradation: ops with unresolved scope are categorized as "other" |
| Not a replacement for static templates | Trace extraction is a validation and discovery tool; static templates remain the primary fast-analysis path | Use trace extraction to verify templates for new models, then update `model-config-index.json` if discrepancies are found |
